h2. The Thinker

After <a target="_blank" href="http://rubyforge.org/projects/asproject/">over 4 years</a> of thinking, rethinking, designing, implementing and reimplementing, I'm elated to announce the immediate availability of the Project Sprouts version 1.0 beta.

You can install the beta as follows:

You can test out the Flash SDK with:

{% highlight bash %}
gem install flashsdk --pre
{% endhighlight %}

You should receive further instructions in your terminal after installation.

h2. Moar Plz!

This release represents a nearly complete rewrite of Sprouts internals with a focus on testability, extensibility and decoupling. This build sets out to solve - in a general way - many problems associated with building cross platform, distributed tools with Ruby, and along the way, it makes life much easier for those of us that work with ActionScript or Flex. As you dig around and uncover various dark corners, you're likely to notice areas that could use some improvement. You may even stumble over an error or two. If you see anything at all suspicious (especially full-blown failures), please do <a target="_blank" href="http://groups.google.com/group/projectsprouts/">let us know</a>.

If you're working with ActionScript 3.0 or Flex projects, please check out this latest release. This release does _not_ include support for ActionScript 2.0 projects, and unless someone from the community contributes that functionality, it probably isn't going to get done.

While the new style of Rake tasks should be familiar to anyone using Sprouts 0.7, legacy Rakefiles will not run without modification.

If you're migrating a legacy Sprouts project, please check out the "migration guide":/2010/12/29/migrating.html.

We are also working hard to completely revamp our "documentation":/docs/1.1/index.html using the <a target="_blank" href="http://yardoc.org/">Yard documentation engine</a>. 

We still have a handful of features that need some attention, so if you've been meaning to contribute some time to an open-source project, this could be a great opportunity.

This is also the inaugural post to the new Project Sprouts Blog!

h2. Thanks for your support!

I sincerely hope you enjoy this new release of Sprouts, it is truly so much easier to test and extend and work with. I have high hopes for our growing community in the coming months and years.
