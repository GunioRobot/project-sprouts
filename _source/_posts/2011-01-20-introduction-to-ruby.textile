This means that Ruby has opinions, and many of Ruby's opinions are exactly inverted from what you may have grown to love in ActionScript. There was a time when this made me uncomfortable, and I'm sure it will make some of you uncomfortable. Well, not _you_ of course, but maybe someone you know...

The intention of this article, is to provide a brief introduction to Ruby for developers that are already familiar with ActionScript 3.0. It is not my intention to provide comprehensive coverage of the Ruby language here. For a much more well-written and far more comprehensive explanation of Ruby, please take the time to read <a target="_blank" href="http://mislav.uniqpath.com/poignant-guide/">Why's Poignant Guide to Ruby</a>, quite possibly the most entertaining and well-written computer book in history.

h1. Quack like a what?

Ruby is a dynamic language, which means that a variable can be any concrete data type. The important thing is that an object define the methods and attributes that its clients attempt to access. This paradigm is often referred to as <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing">Duck Typing</a>.

When it's unfamiliar, Ruby syntax has a few rules that can trip you up, so I'll kick this off by reviewing some key features of the language.

h2. Trying Ruby

If you have installed Ruby and gotten it into your system path, you can kick off a <a target="_blank" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-eval-print_loop">Read Eval Print Loop (REPL)</a> by typing:

{% highlight bash %}
irb
{% endhighlight %}

_(Type 'quit' and hit enter to leave the REPL)_

The @puts@ method will send a String value to stdout and you can think of this like ActionScript's @trace@ method.

{% highlight ruby %}
puts "Hello World"
{% endhighlight %}

Try running irb and then @puts@ some messages now.

When using irb, you can do the following to try out Sprout features.

{% highlight ruby %}
require 'rubygems'
require 'sprout'

# Output the methods on Sprout (minus the detritus from Object):
puts Sprout.methods - Object.methods

# Output Sprout.home
puts Sprout.home
puts Sprout.cache
{% endhighlight %}

h2. Strings

There are a handful of different ways to declare Strings in Ruby, but the main thing I'd like to highlight here is the difference between single quotes and double quotes.

A String that is defined within single quotes will contain literally whatever is defined within the quotes. This means that backslashes will not be rendered as escape sequences, they will just be backslash characters. There is no way to insert expressions in between single quotes, so if you want to assemble a string with single quotes, this is done by concatenating different strings together.

Single quoted strings require Ruby interpreter to do less work and are therefore preferred. I usually use single quotes wherever I don't need an evaluated expression or escape sequence, but for the benefit of people that don't know about these differences, I do try to use double quotes in generated Rake files wherever someone might try an expression (like in task names for example).

{% highlight ruby %}
puts 'Hello World'
{% endhighlight %}

A String that is defined within double quotes will be interpreted for embedded Ruby expressions and escape sequences will be resolved so that they are replaced with the character literal that they represent.

{% highlight ruby %}
suffix = "World!\n"
str = "Hello #{suffix}"
{% endhighlight %}

If you're coming from ActionScript, you'll probably be tempted to concatenate Strings with expressions like:

{% highlight ruby %}
a = 'aaa'
b = 'bbb'
puts 'a: ' + a + ' b: ' + b
{% endhighlight %}

While this will usually work, it will explode if the expression values are nil. The preferred way to assemble Strings and expression values (especially for debugging), is to use double quotes and Ruby expression syntax like:

{% highlight ruby %}
puts "a: #{a} b: #{b}"
{% endhighlight %}

This will insert an empty String for values that are nil.

h2. Symbols

Ruby has an interesting primitive called a @Symbol@. Symbols are not Strings, but are often used in places where a String might also suffice. There are some differences between Symbols and Strings and the first one is that Symbols are slightly more memory efficient than Strings. 

A Symbol is defined (or referenced) in Ruby with a leading colon as follows:

{% highlight ruby %}
name = :beaker
{% endhighlight %}

A good rule of thumb that Jim Weirich shared and that I agree with, is as follows:

# If the contents (i.e. the sequence of characters) of the object is important, use a String.
# If the identity of the object is important, use a Symbol.

The idea here, is that if you're just trying to give a meaningful name to a pointer (as in Hash keys, or referring to methods by name), then Symbols are probably appropriate. If the value is what's important, Strings might make more sense.

You can transform a String to a Symbol with the @to_sym@ method, and you can transform a Symbol to a String with the @to_s@ method. Outside of a Rails application Strings are not considered equal to Symbols that look similar.

{% highlight ruby %}
:beaker == 'beaker'        # false
:beaker.to_s == 'beaker'   # true
:beaker == 'beaker'.to_sym # true
{% endhighlight %}

Symbols are a tricky part of Ruby and it's important when working with Rake files to understand when a Symbol is appropriate and when it is not. 

In Rake, a Symbol is often used for a Rake task name, _unless_ that task refers to a file, then a String must be used. This is because Symbols cannot include slashes, dots or other important components of a File name.

h2. Parentheses

The parentheses that surround parameters in a Ruby method declaration (and method calls) are _optional_, and by convention, are only used when critical for proper execution, or to improve legibility for nested expressions. As with most things _stylish_, there is <a target="_blank" href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/340624/do-you-leave-parentheses-in-or-out-in-ruby">little consensus</a> on when to use or omit parentheses in Ruby.

This does take some time to get used to, but it leads to some interesting improvements in readability, especially in environments like Rake files.

Following are some examples to help you understand this issue.

This method in ActionScript:

{% highlight javascript %}
public function foo(a:String, b:String):void {
  trace("a: " + a + " b: " + b);
}
{% endhighlight %}

Would be defined like this in Ruby:

{% highlight ruby %}
def foo a, b
  puts "a #{a}, b #{b}"
end
{% endhighlight %}

But may also be written like this:

{% highlight ruby %}
def foo(a, b)
  puts "a #{a}, b #{b}"
end
{% endhighlight %}

Additionally, to call that method in ActionScript you might:

{% highlight ruby %}
foo("bar", "baz");
{% endhighlight %}

But in Ruby:

{% highlight ruby %}
foo "bar", "baz"
{% endhighlight %}

Of course, the following is also valid Ruby:

{% highlight ruby %}
foo("bar", "baz")
{% endhighlight %}

You may be wondering, "When _should_ I add the parens?" at this point. Here is a reasonable example of an expression that needs parens:

{% highlight ruby %}
assert foo("bar", "baz")
{% endhighlight %}

This expression is calling the imaginary @foo@ method, sending it two arguments, @bar@ and @baz@, then it's sending the return value of that method call to the @assert@ method. 

Even though the interpreter can figure out what's going on here, it's arguably more readable to parenthesize nested expressions.

h2. Return values

You should also know that Ruby methods always return a value, whether you use the @return@ keyword or not. The last expression that is evaluated within a Ruby method is what is returned. This can of course, be nil.

h2. Hash Rockets

Ruby Hashes are _(<a target="_blank" href="http://blog.peepcode.com/tutorials/2011/rip-ruby-hash-rocket-syntax">historically</a>)_ delimited by a "Hash Rocket", this is an equal sign, followed by a greater than sign, like:

{% highlight ruby %}
=>
{% endhighlight %}

To show what I mean, the following ActionScript Hash:

{% highlight javascript %}
var hash:Object = { a: 'a', b: 'b', c: 'c' };
{% endhighlight %}

Could be written in Ruby like this:

{% highlight ruby %}
hash = { :a => 'a', :b => 'b', :c => 'c' }
{% endhighlight %}

Even thought the Hash Rocket is no longer required in Ruby 1.9.x, Sprouts is still using it for the time being. We'll likely update to the new (more ECMA-like) syntax at some point in the future.

h2. Hash Brackets

You should also note that, like parentheses on methods, curly brackets around Hashes are optional, so the previous Hash may also be declared like:

{% highlight ruby %}
hash = :a => 'a', :b => 'b', :c => 'c'
{% endhighlight %}

Notice how the Ruby Hash prefixes the Hash keys with a colon. This indicates that we're using Symbols as keys.

h2. Conclusion

That's probably enough Ruby to get you through reading and editing a Rake file. I sincerely hope you find yourself intrigued by this language and, like me, get drawn into a new way of considering programming problems.
